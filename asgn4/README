Files contained:
hello.c
FS_FILE
script
DesignDocument.docx
README

Load FUSE into the kernel:
sudo kldload fuse

Change line 23 which says:
static const char *fs_path = "/home/rgmolina/FS_FILE";
change it to the path where you have placed FS_FILE

Compile with the following command:
cc hello.c -o hello `pkgconf fuse --cflags --libs`

To mount the filesystem, make a new folder with
mkdir newFolder

then run the compiled program like this(in root):
./hello newFolder


To run the script on the filesystem, make sure script is chmodded to runnable, and then use the command
time ./script
in the same directory as the newFolder that the filesystem is mounted on.
This will output several time values, the first time indicates how long the script ran for.

To run the script outside the filesystem, make another new folder, make the folder newFolder in that folder,
and run the command
