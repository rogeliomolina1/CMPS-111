Files contained:
argshell.c
DesignDocument.docx
Makefile
README
shell.l

To compile run the command make. This will create two files:
argshell
lex.yy.c

argshell is the executable file.

Also running make clean will remove argshell, lex.yy.c, and
argshell.core.

After the program has compiled, to run it use command:
./argshell.

Bugs:
Pipes don't work
Redirection of standard error does not work
Chaining with ";" only works with 2 commands for some reason.
